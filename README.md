Sil example repo
==================

This is a repository of live sil code.

The contents can be referenced from any other sil module
using the url `sil://test.twenty_seventeen/2017-02-24T00:00:00MST`
to specify the project path and date.

The results from running the code can be downloaded
from the main sil server,
`https://sque.predictivestatmech.org/projects/test.twenty_seventeen`

Sil is pure functional code, which allows all builds to be parallel.


Get Involved
============

Sil is much bigger than this example.  It is an extensible,
distributed, parallel build system with built-in version control,
package management, and data distribution.
It makes collaboration possible like never before.
An open-source compiler release is coming soon!

We are in the process of building modules for packed arrays
and scientific computing.  Our main focus is big data processing
using open data sets and algorithms.

You can contribute in many ways:

* Develop and publish your own sil code.
* Run a sil build-bot (shipping soon as a native client app in Chrome).
* Improve the sil compiler experience by developing on sil's own source.
* Send a feature request or suggestion for improvement!
